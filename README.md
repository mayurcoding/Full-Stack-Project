# Full Stack Project

## Project Structure

This project is organized into two main folders: `frontend` and `backend`. Each folder contains its own codebase and dependencies, allowing for clear separation of concerns and independent development.

- **frontend/**: Contains all client-side code, assets, and configuration for the user interface. You can use your preferred frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) here. Run and manage this part separately using its own package manager and scripts.

- **backend/**: Contains all server-side code, API routes, business logic, and database integration. This folder is typically built with a backend framework (e.g., Express, Django, Flask) and manages its own dependencies and environment.

This separation enables parallel development, easier maintenance, and the flexibility to deploy or scale each part independently.
