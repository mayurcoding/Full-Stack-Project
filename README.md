# Full Stack Project

## Project Structure

This project is organized into two main folders: `frontend` and `backend`. Each folder contains its own codebase and dependencies, allowing for clear separation of concerns and independent development.

- **frontend/**: Contains all client-side code, assets, and configuration for the user interface. You can use your preferred frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) here. Run and manage this part separately using its own package manager and scripts.

- **backend/**: Contains all server-side code, API routes, business logic, and database integration. This folder is typically built with a backend framework (e.g., Express, Django, Flask) and manages its own dependencies and environment.

## How a Separate Folder Structure Optimizes Development

Organizing a full stack project into separate `frontend` and `backend` folders streamlines the development process in several ways:

- **Parallel Development**: Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously without interfering with each other's codebase.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each part of the application has its own responsibilities, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Independent Dependencies**: Each folder manages its own dependencies and configurations, reducing conflicts and simplifying updates.
- **Simplified Deployment**: You can deploy or scale the frontend and backend independently, optimizing resources and performance.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Clear boundaries between frontend and backend facilitate better collaboration and onboarding for new team members.

This structure ultimately leads to a more organized, maintainable, and scalable project.
